# 🪙 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of gold based on economic indicators such as crude oil price, inflation rate, interest rate, and the US dollar index.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and its price is influenced by various global economic factors. This project demonstrates:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building a **Linear Regression model**
- Model evaluation using visualization
- Predicting gold prices using test data

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used (`gold_price_data.csv`) contains the following features:

- `Crude_Oil_Price`  
- `Inflation_Rate`  
- `Interest_Rate`  
- `US_Dollar_Index`  
- `Gold_Price` *(Target)*
